Hi Ash,

I was not able to load the project today.  I could not fix the errors.  Most were config file errors.  I would like to meet tonight to fix those errors and get the project to load.  I am only free tonight until 9:45 p.m.  So even if it is only a short meeting for half hour or one hour that will be fine until another day.  Let me know.

Thank you,

Marie
