    <aabstract>The National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) is a nationwide network of precipitation monitoring sites. The network is a cooperative effort between many different groups, including the State Agricultural Experiment Stations, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and numerous other governmental and private entities. The NADP/NTN has grown from 22 stations at the end of 1978, our first year, to over 250 sites spanning the continental United States, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The purpose of the network is to collect data on the chemistry of precipitation for monitoring of geographical and temporal long-term trends. The precipitation at each station is collected weekly according to strict clean-handling procedures. It is then sent to the Central Analytical Laboratory where it is analyzed for hydrogen (acidity as pH), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, and base cations (such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium).

    <aabstract>Following the guidelines laid out in the Neuse River Prototype, the proposed structure of the proposed observatory has two basic elements:

1) The SRB hydrologic Observing System is formed as a network of testbeds covering the major physiographic regions of the SRB and designed to make nested observations of water, energy and mass.
2) Cross-cutting science themes will link and synthesize observations across the watershed network and allow a more holistic hydrologic understanding and predictive capability at all scales relevant to the river basin.

    <aabstract>The USGS Chesapeake Bay River Input Monitoring (RIM) Program was established to quantify loads and long-term trends in concentrations of nutrients and suspended material entering the tidal part of the Chesapeake Bay Basin from its nine major tributaries. These nine rivers account for approximately 93% of the streamflow entering Chesapeake Bay from the non-tidal part of its watershed. Results of the RIM program are being used by resource managers, policy makers, and concerned citizens to help evaluate the effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing nutrients and sediment entering Chesapeake Bay from its tributaries.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO) is located in Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico. The multi-disciplinary team of geoscientists working at the site are addressing a set of specific hypotheses that are related to the following overarching questions: How do critical zone processes and the flow and transformations of material differ in landscapes with contrasting bedrock but similar climates, land use, and geologic histories? What are the implications of these differences for the long term sustainability of water and soil resources? Research Overview Specifically, the observatory is quantifying and comparing critical zone (CZ) processes in landforms and watersheds underlain by three different rock types, granodiorites, volcaniclastics, and their associated contact metamorphic rocks. Previous research has demonstrated that these are some of the most rapidly eroding watersheds in the world. There are also dramatic, but poorly quantified, contrasts in CZ processes between areas underlain by these bedrocks. Individual research project include studies of deep weathering, soil formation and soil carbon accumulation, riparian zone dynamics, fluvial geomorphology, and meteorology. Infrastructure includes weather stations, instrumented soil pits and riparian zones, and stream flow gages. The principal researchers and students involve in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory are from the UPENN, the Pennsylvania State University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Puerto Rico, the US Geological Survey, and the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Observatory will also provide facilities for collaborators from a host of US and International Universities and Research Centers</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) is a forested, small, temperate-climate catchment in central Pennsylvania in which the regolith is developing upon homogeneous shale. The purpose of the observatory and associated interdisciplinary research is to quantitatively predict the creation, evolution, and structure of regolith as a function of the geochemical, hydrologic, biologic, and geomorphologic processes operating in a temperate, forested landscape. By creating an interdisciplinary team working collaboratively in one observatory we aim to advance methods for characterizing regolith, to provide a theoretical basis for predicting the distribution and properties of regolith, and to theoretically and experimentally study the impacts of regolith on fluid pathways, flow rates, and residence times. The research site, the focus of National Science Foundation-supported research since the 1970s, has comprehensive datasets on distributed water budgets (1970-75), has served as a model test bed for hydrological response (1998-present), and will be augmented here by new geochemical, geomorphological, ecological, lidar, and soils datasets, all available to the research community. Shale Hills CZO represents an opportunity to investigate the rates and mechanisms of saprolite and soil formation on a relatively simple but ubiquitous bedrock lithology that has been documented to be important in determining global fluxes of C, P, and platinum–group elements worldwide. Furthermore, the regolith at Shale Hills has experienced at least two potentially significant perturbations in the geologically recent past: a climatic perturbation from periglacial to modern conditions, and a biologic perturbation from anthropogenic clearing of forests during and repeatedly since colonial occupation. The magnitude of these perturbations and their influence on regolith generation afford an opportunity to assess the time scales of response of soil production to both long-term climate change and human activity.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>Spatial and temporal integration of carbon and mineral fluxes: a whole watershed approach to quantifying anthropogenic modification of critical zone carbon sequestration. Earth moving by humans associated with agriculture, urbanization, and excavation re-contours entire landscapes and constitutes a major geological force within the Critical Zone of planet Earth. The Critical Zone, defined as the terrestrial layer extending from tree tops through the groundwater and into stream networks, sustains most terrestrial life on the planet. At a greater rate than ever in Earth’s history, erosion and excavation expose sub-soil materials and unweathered minerals, which mix into and within soils and are transported as sediment loads through river networks, from headwaters to estuaries. To quantify the impacts on the global carbon cycle of humans as geological agents, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the University of Delaware (UD) and Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) will establish a Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) within the 1440 km2 Christina River drainage basin (CRB/CZO). Scientific investigations within the CRB/CZO, located in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Northern Delaware and straddling unglaciated Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, will test the following overarching hypothesis: Humans, by accelerating the introduction of minerals into biologically and chemically active zones, significantly enhance the interactions between minerals and organic matter and create globally significant impacts on the exchange of carbon between the land and the atmosphere. The human footprint within the CRB/CZO spans centuries, and current land uses include second-growth forests, agriculture, and suburban and urban development This provides an ideal natural laboratory in which we will investigate fundamental biological, chemical, and geological processes within the Critical Zone along a gradient of human impacts. We will particularly focus on the sources, transport and fates of water, sediments and carbon from uplands to inland waters and from inland waters to the coastal zone. The CRB/CZO will utilize cutting edge technologies for real-time gathering of hydrological, physical and chemical data and advances in cyber-infrastructure that seamlessly merge real-time data with state-of-the-art graphics tools to provide timely open access to quality controlled data and supporting materials. Field installations and data management advances will enhance an extensive existing network of stations used for monitoring water flow and water chemistry within the CRB basin, including Delaware Coastal Waters, and will build upon a solid foundation of decades of research conducted by UD, SWRC, and numerous state, federal, and non-governmental agencies. The CRB/CZO will serve as a resource to the greater scientific community through open access to data and opportunities for research projects that take advantage of the enhanced monitoring network. The new Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN), located at UD, and Delaware's National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) will partner with the CRB/CZO on outreach activities. Public outreach to stakeholders within the Christina Basin is a critical step in making CRB/CZO data available to policy makers. Strong ties between UD and Delaware state agencies will enhance the sharing of environmental data and will provide outreach to the public and to policy makers. Some of our outreach will be coordinated through the Water Resources Agency, part of the UD Institute for Public Administration. The Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies, hosts an annual series of public workshops to identify the science needs of policy makers. We will incorporate science results from the CRB/CZO into these workshops with the goal of providing a direct interface between science and public policy. The SWRC maintains 4 full-time staff members to translate our research into educational programs for middle- and high school-aged students, teachers, and citizen/conservation groups. Graduate students who are involved with the CRB/CZO will be advised by multidisciplinary team of scientists associated with the DENIN and with scientists at SWRC. Collaborations with other academic and federal agency personnel will further enhance interdisciplinary research, student education, and public outreach.</aabstract>

Geophys. Res., 109, D07S90, doi:10.1029/2003JD003823.</citation>
    <aabstract>The goal of NLDAS is to construct quality-controlled, and spatially and temporally consistent, land-surface model (LSM) datasets from the best available observations and model output to support modeling activities. Specifically, this system is intended to reduce the errors in the stores of soil moisture and energy which are often present in numerical weather prediction models, and which degrade the accuracy of forecasts. NLDAS is currently running in near real-time on a 1/8th-degree grid over central North America; retrospective NLDAS datasets and simulations also extend back to January 1979. NLDAS constructs a forcing dataset from gauge-based observed precipitation data (temporally disaggregated using Stage II radar data), bias-correcting shortwave radiation, and surface meteorology reanalyses to drive several different LSMs to produce model outputs of surface fluxes, soil moisture, and snow cover.

NLDAS is a collaboration project among several groups: NOAA/NCEP's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the University of Washington, the NOAA/NWS Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), and the NOAA/NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). NLDAS is a core project with support from NOAA's Climate Prediction Program for the Americas (CPPA). Data from the project can be accessed from the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) as well as from the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website. 

This service provides access to NASA's North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) hourly Mosaic land surface model data.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Muddy River is located in Brookline and Boston, Massachusetts and is tributary to the lower Charles River. The watershed has drainage area of 6.32 mi2, an average slope of 7.2 percent and mixed land use (46% single family, 14% multi-family, 10%
commercial, 16% urban open, 7% forest, 7% other, USGS). The river has been altered
significantly from its natural form. It is part of the Emerald Necklace park system
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the late 1800’s. The Muddy River is designated
by the MA DEP as Class B (fishable, swimmable)The Muddy River, like many other urban rivers, has been subject to significant pollution,
including combined sewer discharges, urban runoff discharges, shoreline encroachment,
culverting, etc. Several recent floods have caused significant property damage and recent studies have identified water quality concerns, which lead to the Muddy River Restoration Project.
Northeastern University carried out a 3-year water quality monitoring project. Samples were collected three times per quarter, from 14 stations and analyzed for 36 parameters. Details of the procedures were presented previously in the Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (dated April 13, 2007). The historical data were summarized in a Historical Data Report (dated March 7, 2007). Data, including data quality results and discussion were
submitted on a quarterly basis in 13 Data Reports. The purpose of this final report is to summarize and discuss the data, and to provide recommendations for future studies.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Weiherbach catchment is an extensively studied hydrological catchment. Starting from the 1990's there have been ongoing hydrological measurement campaigns in the Weiherbach area, which is an intensively used agricultural area. Many PhD theses have been written on the hydrological behaviour of the catchment. Future research projects are already planned which will allow for continuation of the monitoring. This project was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), project numbers SCHR 1000/3-1 and ZE 533/5-1.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The ShaleNetwork is a group of individuals working together to organize water quality and quantity data in regions where shale gas is being exploited. The Steering Committee of the ShaleNetwork derive from Dickinson College, Pitt University, Penn State, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. This group was funded by the National Science Foundation in October 2011 to put together the database and to run annual workshops between 2012 and 2015. The ShaleNetwork database will connect researchers, agencies, industry representatives, and community organizers together to generate societally-relevant knowledge from data collected by diverse groups of scientists and citizens. The ShaleNetwork acts as an “honest broker” that collates datasets and learns and teaches how to synthesize that data into useful knowledge. The network will be informed by the understanding developed by Dickinson Colleges' ALLARM program over the last 25 years working with citizen scientists. The ALLARM approach stresses that observational data can act like a “canary in a coal mine” to help communities. </aabstract>

    <aabstract>The Ipswich River Watershed Association’s (IRWA) RiverWatch water quality monitoring program, in operation since 1997, enlists volunteers to collect data on the health of the Ipswich River and its tributaries. Volunteers monitor according to a state-approved monitoring plan that ensures that the data they collect is of good quality. The goals of the program are to document River conditions in order to identify water quality problems (including adequate river flow) and to use this data to develop solutions to observed problems.</aabstract>

Geophys. Res., 109, D07S90, doi:10.1029/2003JD003823.</citation>
    <aabstract>The goal of NLDAS is to construct quality-controlled, and spatially and temporally consistent, land-surface model (LSM) datasets from the best available observations and model output to support modeling activities. Specifically, this system is intended to reduce the errors in the stores of soil moisture and energy which are often present in numerical weather prediction models, and which degrade the accuracy of forecasts. NLDAS is currently running in near real-time on a 1/8th-degree grid over central North America; retrospective NLDAS datasets and simulations also extend back to January 1979. NLDAS constructs a forcing dataset from gauge-based observed precipitation data (temporally disaggregated using Stage II radar data), bias-correcting shortwave radiation, and surface meteorology reanalyses to drive several different LSMs to produce model outputs of surface fluxes, soil moisture, and snow cover. NLDAS is a collaboration project among several groups: NOAA/NCEP's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the University of Washington, the NOAA/NWS Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), and the NOAA/NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). NLDAS is a core project with support from NOAA's Climate Prediction Program for the Americas (CPPA). Data from the project can be accessed from the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) as well as from the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website.

NLDAS is currently running in near real-time on a 1/8th-degree grid over central North America; retrospective NLDAS datasets and simulations also extend back to January 1979. NLDAS constructs a forcing dataset from gauge-based observed precipitation data (temporally disaggregated using Stage II radar data), bias-correcting shortwave radiation, and surface meteorology reanalyses to drive several different LSMs to produce model outputs of surface fluxes, soil moisture, and snow cover. NLDAS is a collaboration project among several groups: NOAA/NCEP's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the University of Washington, the NOAA/NWS Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), and the NOAA/NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). NLDAS is a core project with support from NOAA's Climate Prediction Program for the Americas (CPPA). Data from the project can be accessed from the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) as well as from the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website. This service provides access to NASA's North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) hourly Mosaic land surface model data.</aabstract>

    <aabstract>The present IEER database contains re-published water quality data from the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (http://www.srbc.net/).

SRBC’s Remote Water Quality Monitoring Network is guided by six primary objectives: 1. To establish a real-time monitoring network at areas of concern in the Susquehanna River Basin; network provides monitoring data to resource agencies, the regulated community and the public to allow timely response in the case of pollution incidents; 2. To establish baseline water quality conditions in targeted areas of the basin; 3. To verify whether or not the natural gas industry and/or other activities with the potential to cause pollution incidents are causing adverse impacts on local water quality; 4. To reduce the cost of data collection through the use of advanced technologies; to form collaborative partnerships to improve monitoring technology and provide educational opportunities; 5. To enhance water supply protection through source water monitoring; and 6. To be responsive to public concerns.
